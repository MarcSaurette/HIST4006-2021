# Setting up new digital resources



### Github

You are (likely) currently reading this on Gitbook, derived from files hosted on Github. You can see the Github file for this page [here](https://github.com/MarcSaurette/Gitbook/blob/master/week-1-and-2/signing-up.md). That file is written in "Markdown", a simple text formatting language. For a guide to writing .md (markdown) files, take a look [here](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/). But your first steps should be:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account - either by going to the top right hand corner of this page and click on the Sign Up link or by clicking [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-repo). Try to make it possible for me to identify you from your username (such as using your real name).&#x20;
2. Go to Slack and in the channel, "Github" and post your profile address. My personal Github profile is [https://github.com/MarcSaurette](https://github.com/MarcSaurette) and our shared organizational account is [https://github.com/MedievalBook](https://github.com/MedievalBook).
3. Try to [integrate your account](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/232289568-GitHub-for-Slack) on Slack. I think it should be as easy as typing "/github signin" under the Slack app channel and then following the instructions they provide, It might not. If not, let me know on Slack.
4. The reason why you need to let me know you're profile is so that I can invite you to join the organizational Github [MedievalBook](https://github.com/MedievalBook). This might take a day or so for me to do, but you can keep going before that happens.
5. Navigate to our organizational [repository](https://github.com/MedievalBook/HIST4006) and press on the button "Fork" at the top right hand corner of the page. "Forking" copies the contents of this repository to your own Github repository so you can edit it.
6. On your forked repository (which automatically will be given the name `[Your username]/HIST4006`), edit the Readme.md file by clicking the file name and then on the pencil icon at the top right corner of the text box. You should add you name and link to your Github profile in the following fashion: `- [Name that you want to appear](url of your Github profile)` `- [Marc Saurette](https://github.com/MarcSaurette)`
7. Press the "Commit Changes" button to save the file.&#x20;
8. There are several readme.md files in the various folders - so be sure you edited only the Readme.md in the /HIST4006 folder.&#x20;
9. Now return to the Folios folder of your repository (something like Username/HIST4006/Folios) and create a new file by clicking on the "Create New File" button that should be middle to top right corner of the page. You will be prompted to give it a name.&#x20;
10. Use the following convention: "Your last name, Code for text." E.g. `Saurette, Ottawa CU ARC charter 2`. Here CU = Carleton University and ARC = Archives and Research Collection. Your texts will usually either be "ARC ms. fol. X" or "CUAG ms. fol. Y" if it is one of the manuscript (ms.) folios (fol.) on loan to ARC from the Carleton University Art Gallery.&#x20;
11. Press the "Commit Changes" button to save the file.
12. Now look for the tab "Pull Requests" on the top left corner of the page. Click on it. Then click on the green button on the top right corner "New Pull Request". This will load a page entitled "Comparing changes" and if all is well, then you can press the green button "Create new pull request".
13. You will be prompted to type a title, which can be something as simple as "\[Your name here] is updating the readme.md file and adding their folio page". You don't need to add any description. You can choose to be more whimsical in your prose.
14. Then press the green button "Create Pull Request". And you are done.&#x20;
15. I need to approve your "Pull Request", which updates your changes to the master copy at [https://github.com/MedievalBook](https://github.com/MedievalBook). You should get a notification when I have approved your request.

**Next Steps:**

1. Complete the GitHub [starter guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) through the browser portal. Optional: look through as many guides as interest you, [here](https://guides.github.com).
2. [Download](https://desktop.github.com) the GitHub desktop which allows you to manage/work with your GitHub files offline. Install and set up the desktop version.
3. Press the "Fetch" Button, to download your online files to your hard drive. Locate where these files are on your hard drive for future reference.

### Atom or others

[Atom](https://atom.io) is a free and simple text editor, useful for working with many different kinds of file formats that we will use this year, including MD, HTML and TEI files. If you use Linux, you can also use [Remarkable](https://remarkableapp.github.io) for editing markdown files (.md), which has the benefit of providing a live preview of how the file will look online. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is another option for Linux, Windows and Mac; with a bit of work it can also be configured to provide a live preview.

1. Download Atom [here](https://atom.io).
2. Install Atom on your hard drive.
3. Open Atom and from the Welcome Guide (which should be in an open tab), click on the button "Version control with Git and GitHub". Following the instructions to sign onto your Github. If you donâ€™t want your lines going all the way across the screen, click View >> Toggle Soft Wrap.
4. Next find your repository "HIST4006" (usually inside a folder "GitHub") on your hard drive. There should be a folder entitled "Folios" and inside it should be a copy of your file that you created through the web interface.  Open your file (something like`Saurette, Ottawa CU ARC charter 2`) with Atom or other app. Add a line to this file saying "\[Your name here] has successfully edited this file on their desktop with a text editor."
5. Save the file.
6. Open the Github desktop. It should already have noted that the your file has changed. In the "Summary" field, add something like "changed my folio file", then press the "Commit to master" button at the bottom left hand corner. Then press the "Push Origin" button at the top right (same button you previously used it to fetch, now with a different caption).
7. If I've laid this out properly, you will have learned how to successfully edit something so that it can be easily shared with the group.
8. If you want to learn more about Atom, here is a useful and quick [tutorial](https://www.portent.com/blog/content-strategy/atom-markdown.htm).
