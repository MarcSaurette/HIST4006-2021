# Pandemic Learning

{% hint style="info" %}
This year life will continue to be more difficult for you than other years. Even though we will be in class together, we will need to be masked and practice social distancing, so this makes face-to-face learning a bit atypical (less natural?). So, please, if you need some help (in class, in life) please reach out to me so I can do whatever I can or put you in contact with people who can help.

Teaching and learning this year will continue to be an experiment. How we can learn on campus may change – depending on rules become more strict or less depending on the vagaries of the pandemic. How many people can be in a particular space (like the Book Arts lab) may change, which might alter how teaching happens. We might make changes to assignments and work flow depending on how people feel works best for everyone. Thus I will try to be extra patient and understanding (and I hope so will all of you) when things don't go as smoothly as we'd like.

We don't know how things are going to look in October, let alone January, so please understand if schedules get derailed and learning doesn't happen exactly as hoped for. Experiments in learning can pay off if we accept the risks.

## Class Design <a href="#class-design" id="class-design"></a>

Given the uncertainty about the cyclical nature of the covid-19 pandemic, it is not clear at the time we are designing this course, what will be the exact teaching conditions of the upcoming academic year. We may be switching between face-to-face class time and online learning \[edit: the Academic senate just voted to extend online only until the Winter semester on August 24th], so we have tried as best we could to make lectures, assignments and learning happen in either situation.

We will all need to recognize that there may be some slight revisions to the course and its requirements if it turns out that not all of the elements we planned are amenable to the distance learning format, so please treat the syllabus more like an intended plan of action than a hard-and-fast legally-binding agreement.

## Things to Keep in Mind <a href="#things-to-keep-in-mind" id="things-to-keep-in-mind"></a>

To succeed in the course, it may require more energy and discipline (or at least different kinds) from you than a traditional face-to-face course.

**Motivation**: Motivation can always be challenging. I suspect that in our context (e.g. almost everyone has a lot of additional concerns/ issues/ considerations above and beyond the normal amount) finding the motivation to buckle down on our courses might be extra challenging. Having even just a bit of live face-to-face time in the classroom (especially with your peers) can provide a surprising amount of energy and motivation… and you might be surprised by the impact of losing these moments.

**Responsibility for learning**: In contrast to many first- and second-year courses, the bulk of the learning on online courses takes place autonomously - e.g. while you are reading, analyzing and synthesizing the texts; producing your written assignments; critically engaging with lectures; class and small group discussions; etc. In this context, you will need to take even more responsibility for your own learning.

**Difficulty of concentration**: One of the reasons that I believe in-person classes remain so important, even in our online age, is because it gives us spaces in which we can switch off our devices and all of the distractions they offer, and hone the absolutely vital skill of concentration (a skill that is vital both for having a successful learning experience in this course, but also for life in general). Carving out spaces of intensive concentration (while in class, doing your readings, working on your syntheses and other written assignments) at home will no doubt be much more challenging, for a variety of reasons.

**Tech problems**: no doubt there will be both a significant learning curve for all of us in terms of how the various pieces of software work, as well as a variety of tech mishaps due to the demands of internet streaming, etc. We’ll have to become skilled at quickly problem solving these together. I am no tech genius and I suspect Carleton's IT staff will be swamped this Fall as all teaching does online. So hopefully together we can sort out issues.
