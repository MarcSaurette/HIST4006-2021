# Research

In the Fall term, students will focus their study on one of Carleton's medieval folios (the art and science of _fragmentology_). The goal will be to gather information, contextualize your folio through additional readings/ research and present the folio to your fellow students at the end of term.&#x20;

1. **Gather information**. As we do exercises in class in first term, you will learn terminology and the means to gather different kinds of information about your folio. You will describe and transcribe a folio.
2. **Contextualize**. You will do research on your folio, trying to figure out more information about by reading secondary sources and comparing it to other digitized manuscripts.
3. **Present**. In the final class of first term, you will offer a quick (10 minute) presentation (oral + slideshow) describing your findings and what you found interesting about it.&#x20;
4. **Catalogue.** The final descriptions/transcripts of the folios will be put together into a shared catalogue (written using uniform structures and styles) in a jointly authored google document. Together we will write up a short introduction to the medieval material we study.&#x20;

The next stage, an [Exhibition](exhibition.md), will get us to present information to the public.
