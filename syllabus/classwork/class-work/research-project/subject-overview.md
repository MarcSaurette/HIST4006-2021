# Subject Overview

At the end of term, the final component of each student's research work is to take their contributions to the [Folio Workshops](folio-workshops.md) and turn it into a well-supported and documented 1500 word contribution to the manuscript catalogue.&#x20;

Each contribution should:

* work towards constructing a timeline of the fragments
* show a command of scholarship and analysis of the the chosen topic
* use written argument and images to support their argument
* provide an exhaustive overview of our collections
