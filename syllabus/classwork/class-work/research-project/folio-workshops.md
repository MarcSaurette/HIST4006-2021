# Folio workshops

In the first half of the Winter semester, we will spend part of each class workshopping each other's catalogue entries. This workshop is meant to practice the collaborative work of putting together a scholarly resource like a manuscript catalogue. These will also allow us to explore areas of research (i.e. interest driven learning).&#x20;

1. The week before we discuss a catalogue entry, the author should indicate via a post on Teams what things they might wish help with. What would they like to learn more about (or what do they think others might learn from it)? Do they need further help with transcription? Do you want to learn more about Southern Textualis?&#x20;
2. In advance of each class, we will all read through the catalogue entries assigned  that week (usually two or three). In the google documents, we will offer peer-editing suggestions or make comments designed to improve the catalogue entry (including links or bibliographical suggestions for further research). Students can also discuss stylistic matters - e.g. how to standardize the entries or common terminology to use (etc.)
3. Every student in class (other than those whose entries are assigned) will choose one aspect (of the many possibiilities) to do further research on. This research will then inform our comments during the workshop about what we all were helping to add to our understanding of each folio.&#x20;
4. These suggestions and research will be used by the original authors to revise their catalogue entries, which will be **due two weeks** after we workshop the folio.&#x20;

### Specialized Areas of Expertise:

Students will choose to focus on specific codicological topics over the course of the seven weeks of the workshop. Students will become the expert commentator in workshops on their field of expertise.  Potential areas of focus could be (but are not limited to):

* ornamentation and decoration
* marginalia (this might be hard due to lack of marginalia generally)
* rubrication
* initials
* palaeography (or perhaps only specific letters)
* supports
* mise-en-page

In the final part of the course, students will write up an overarching examination of their chosen area for the catalogue. Thus, we will have someone (or perhaps more than one person) providing an overview of the scripts (and their timeline) that our collection demonstrates.&#x20;

### Workshop Schedule

We will be talking about your catalogue descriptions on the date noted. This means noting areas of discussion/ research should be posted a week beforehand.&#x20;
