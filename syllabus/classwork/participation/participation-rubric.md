# Participation Rubric

You will be asked to evaluate your own participation for this class. The following is a rough guide for thinking about our expectations:

**A range:** Attended all of the time. Participated frequently. Participation almost always addressed pertinent issues, and demonstrated a clear understanding of the readings. Participation frequently or always integrated readings into the arguments made. In general, convincingly demonstrated thorough understanding of the readings and material under discussion.

**B range:** Attended most or all of the time. Participated frequently. Participation usually addressed pertinent issues. Readings not always integrated into the arguments made during the games, or didnâ€™t always demonstrate complete understandings of the readings.

**C range:** Attended most or all of the time. Participated reasonably often, but participation indicated lack of complete understanding and seldom cited readings OR participated only occasionally, but in ways that demonstrated clear understanding of the course  and used he ideas of the readings successfully in addressing issues under discussion.

**D range:** Attended most of the time, but seldom participated. Participation indicated little understanding of the game or of the readings upon which the game was based.

**F**: Rarely attended, said little, openly ignored class requirements.
