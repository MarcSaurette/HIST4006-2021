# Key Dates

The idea of a seminar is that we are working together to explore a topic - in our case the history of medieval manuscripts. Everyone has different deadlines for the most part. People will lead seminars in succession and produce written work according to their individual schedule.&#x20;

The onus is therefore on students to keep track of when they need to get their work done.&#x20;

Reading and annotation must be done each week. This is the most important part of the class. Annotating will identify themes/ topics you wish to discuss in class.&#x20;

If you are leading a seminar, you need to prepare in advance (you should identify questions you want the students to consider at least a week in advance).&#x20;
