# Digital Tools

In this course we will be experimenting with different platforms for presenting, editing and rebuilding medieval texts. We often think of digitization as taking and making image electronically available, but source texts can be transformed into digital surrogates in many ways. Also, digitization projects are rarely individual enterprises â€“ they tend to require teams of scholars each with their own specialization and skills. Likewise, I fully expect students to have more ease with some aspects of the course than others, and while I expect all student to try out all the tools we'll be testing, I do not expect you to become proficient in them all. In the class, you show try everything, but then also be ok gravitating to what works best for you (which might not be the same as for other students).&#x20;

You might not think it, but the biggest hassle for you this year will be keeping track of all your usernames and passwords for the different accounts and platforms we will use. Please write them down somewhere even your computer automatically saves them.&#x20;
