# Cataloguing

Our goal by the end of first term is to turn all of the work we have studying the medieval folios in Carleton's collection, into a usable and stable catalogue that can be consulted by future researchers.&#x20;

The evolving google document (visible below) contains our incipient descriptions of the medieval material at Carleton University, as well as a overview of our collection.&#x20;
