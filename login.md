# How to join the class

Our classes are scheduled take place in person on Thursdays from 11h30 until 2h30 ~~in~~ [~~Room 213~~](https://carleton.ca/ims/rooms/residence-commons-213/)~~,~~ [~~Residence Commons~~](https://carleton.ca/campus/map/#CO) room 1020 Dunton Tower. They have just changed the room (without me knowing). **We might try to move again,** because Dunton tower is usually pretty terrible for teaching in.&#x20;

In order to prepare for the worst case scenario of a temporary switch to online, we will run the course using MS Teams. If all goes well, we can use Teams for messaging, storing files, discussing or asking questions outside of class time, and potentially it can be used for virtual office hours/ student meetings. We can also run classes on it, or have guest speakers.&#x20;

&#x20;It is important that you get Teams and [Perusall](syllabus/digital-tools/perusall.md) working as soon as possible. **Perusall** is easy to get working - we're using it to store class readings and as an annotation platform. **Teams**, if you haven't used it before at Carleton, may not be. So please try to login before class starts in September.

In preparation for using Teams for class/ videoconferencing, please follow the steps outlined below.

Having helped students and colleagues try to use Teams last year, I know that it can be either easy to login or quite frustrating. The ratio seems to be about 50/50. So please do not leave it to just before class to try to get it running!

1. Figure out your Carleton email, either by activating it for the first time or ensuring that you are able to use it. See [here for instructions](https://carleton.ca/its/all-services/email/carleton-student-email/).
2. â€‹Install Teams on your computer and set it up. If at all possible don't use the browser version.
3. Make sure you are part of the "HIST4006" Team.
4. If our Team doesn't pop up as an option in your Teams dashboard, click on the "Join or Create a Team" button and enter the code: **uirnw4t.** This will only work if you are correctly logged in with your Carleton account.
5. Find the general channel and text "hello" and introduce yourself to tell us that you're successfully logged in.
